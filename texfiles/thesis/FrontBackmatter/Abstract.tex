\chapter*{Abstract}
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) in neuromorphic systems are more energy efficient compared to deep learning--based methods, but there is no clear competitive learning algorithm for training such SNNs.
Eligibility propagation (e-prop) offers an efficient and biologically plausible way to train competitive recurrent SNNs in low-power neuromorphic hardware.
In this report, previous performance of e-prop on a speech classification task is reproduced, and the effects of inluding STDP-like behavior is analyzed.
A new neuron model that shows STDP-like behavior performs competitively, but this is not the case in the new Izhikevich e-prop neuron.
Finally, e-prop implemented in a single-layer recurrent SNN consistently outperforms a multi-layer variant.
