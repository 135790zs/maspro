- DISCUSSION PLACEHOLDER

- STDP is not important for good performance in e-prop.
- A multi-layer architecture slows has a theoretical advantage (src?) but raises sparsity issues
\end{tcolorbox}

Future research:
- Beta, rho, alpha, synaptic delay not constant but spread
- ahmed1998estimates finds that deeper layers have slower and weaker adaptation rates than shallow layers.
