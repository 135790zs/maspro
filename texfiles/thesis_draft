STRUCTURE
* Introduction
  - Artificial spiking neurons inspired by brain neurons (as in Bellec intro p1). Various theoretical advantages over ANNs.
  - Unclear how RSNNs can learn. In hope of crudely emulating biological neural circuits, try online, local and bioplausible method.
  - E-prop uses bio-inspired (which) methods that allow for online, local, bioplausible training and have shown to yield good results.
  - However, real neurons are stacked in layers. This paper generalizes e-prop to multiple layers. (short parallel to perceptrons vs, MLPs? will need some theoretical analysis like MLPs could nonlinearly separate. Time dynamics maybe?)
  - ... synaptic scaling, Izhikevich etc will depend on whether it is implemented.

* METHOD
  - In method, first general top-down formulas (derivatives etc). Derive from RNNs. Explain Traub fix or Bellec reset if applicable.
* RESULTS
* DISCUSSION
* CONCLUSION

* APPENDIX
