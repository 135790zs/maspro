General:

Class-based object, with modules for:
- Visualization
- Logging to plaintext
- Updating
  - Decouple local update, decouple all STDP functions.
- Regularization
  - Metaplasticity
  - Synaptic scaling
- Adding or pruning neurons by shrinking/growing neuron matrix.
- Set of modulators

---
Spike rails are:
- Variable length
  - Modifiable, possibly altered by update
- Matrix-based lengths (2D)
- Matrix-based rails (3D)

---
Set of neurons is:
- Collection of matrices
  - Activation
  - Local threshold
  - Synaptic strength
    - Initialization decoupled to test topologies/weights

---
IO:
- Predefined set of input neurons
  - Can be grown or shrunk by using pruning module.
  - Have no incoming neurons
- Predefined set of output neurons
  - Can be grown or shrunk by using pruning module.
  - Have no outgoing neurons

--------

Design order
- Tracer bullet approach:
  - Demo with input-output
  - Placeholder update function
  - No logging, vis, or noise
