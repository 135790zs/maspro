Idea: Try using spike rates to approximate STDP (Sboev20)

=====================

Idea:
* Implement Hao19 (scaling & DA-STDP) in a dynamic reservoir, and evaluate with temporal dataset.
* Formalize dynamics (with help of Legenstein20)
* Test/compare variety of plasticity rules.
* Test/compare robustness of various neuron models (LIF, HH, etc).
* Test bio-plausible ranges, but also attempt to abstract away without losing accuracy.
* Try spike rates instead of spike time. Will require adaptation of STDP.
* Convert temporal data to Poisson-distributed spikes (why?), then feed to reservoir of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Output is converted back.
* Examine role of visual attention. Makes it truly dynamical. Output for selecting input frame, 2/4 extra outputs but much fewer inputs.
* Try max/avgpooling the input.

* Think of methods to prune or expand the network by pruning unused connections/units, inserting units near strong connections, etc. (Elbez20)
* Think of ways to visualize a reservoir clustering. Some way to process the topology to give insight in dynamics w.r.t. input-output pairs.
* More on the side: research in what type of neuromorphic chip this can be implemented.
* Examine initial weights (Kim20) or topologies (Iranmehr19, Roy16a).

--------------------------------------

* Implement Hao2019 in a dynamic reservoir, and evaluate multiple temporal datasets (visual, 1D, problem solving, etc).
* Test metaplasticity in addition to, or instead of, dynamic thresholding.
* Formalize the dynamics.
* Test variety of plasticity rules.
* Test variety of neuron models.
* Test initial weights & topology
* Try SRDP.
* Try reducing input size through pooling or visual attention.
* Examine pruning.
* Examine full network binarization.
* Examine ways to gather insight into internal clustering.
* Research neuromorphology options w.r.t. this system.
* Reformalize the dynamics based on what (combinations of) improvements work.
* Research biological plausibility for discussion, analysis for future research.

Hao et al. proposed a feedforward SNN with a reinforcement-based symmetric plasticity rule DA-STDP, observed in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. They create homeostaticity through synaptic scaling and dynamic thresholding. They achieve good accuracy and well-clustered results. However, feedforward can only deal with static data.

I propose to implement DA-STDP, synaptic scaling, and dynamic thresholding in a fully-recurrent network, and evaluate it on various types of temporal data, including classifying and predicting visual and abstract data, but also situational problem solving.

When I have the infrastructure of this code present and achieve a good performance, I can start doing some more experimental work:
- Testing metaplasticity, which is also well-founded in neuroscientific research.
- Testing a variety of plasticity rules, including R-STDP (Mozafari18, Legenstein20) but also different curves.
- Testing different types of neuron models, including (L)IF, HH, etc.
- Testing different types of topology and weight initialization (Kim20).
- Testing methods to prune or expand the network by pruning unused connections/units, inserting units near strong connections, etc. (Elbez20).
- Try rate-based plasticity.
- Try reducing the network input through pooling or visual attention.
- Examine full network & state binarization.
- Examine ways to gether insight into internal clustering
- Research neuromorphology options w.r.t. this system.
- Reformalize the dynamics based on what (combinations of) improvements work.
- Research biological plausibility for discussion, analysis for future research.
