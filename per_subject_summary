STDP
- Assumed to be fundamental learning principle (Traub20)
- Potential, because: (Demin18)
    (1) new bio-inspired self-learning methods (less data)
    (2) Complex architectures and layer types
    (3) Neuromorphic hardware
- Local dendritic depolarization related STDP might lead to new algorithm (Taherkhani20)


R-STDP
- Ability top memorize temporal spike patterns (Demin18)
- Finding forage by robot (Demin18)
- MNIST benchmark in feedforward (Demin18)

SNN
- Traditional way of setting weights: (Demin18)
    (1) transfer from formal NN;
    (2) modifying formal NN algorithms
    (3) local learning rules
